## About Me

I'm an engineering student at KTH studying Information Technology, with a genuine interest in backend development, APIs, and working with hardware close to the network layer. I like building things that actually work — from prototype to something you can demonstrate — and I'm comfortable going from reading documentation to writing and debugging code on my own.

Alongside my studies, I work as a Security Officer at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, which has taught me a lot about responsibility, clear communication, and staying focused under pressure.

I'm currently looking for internships or part-time developer roles in Sweden where I can contribute and keep growing.

## Featured Projects

### Salti CS — VoWiFi / WiFi Calling Prototype

A proof-of-concept system for voice-over-WiFi calling, built on Raspberry Pi 4B+ hardware with a Python/FastAPI backend and a JavaScript client for testing and visualization.

- Connected a **Raspberry Pi 4B+** (with SIM7600 module) to a web-controlled backend via REST/JSON APIs
- Designed and implemented **call setup and device-control API endpoints** in FastAPI
- Built a lightweight **JavaScript client** to trigger test flows and visualize device status in real time
- Carried out systematic debugging, testing, and iterative improvements throughout the project

**Tech:** Python · FastAPI · Raspberry Pi 4B+ · SIM7600 · JavaScript · REST APIs
